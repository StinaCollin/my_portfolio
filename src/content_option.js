Creativity runs in my blood since birth, thanks to my mother who is a celebrated and eminent artist and dollhouse maker. I founded my first company at just 15, specializing in clothing design, and was self-learned in developing my own webshop. Since then, I've launched two more ventures, honing my skills in various design fields. With a solid background in design, I enrolled at IT Högskolan to gain strong skills in development as well. I'm always eager for new challenges, and I'm a social butterfly, always keen to meet new people and expand my horizons. And last but not least, I'm always wearing a smile and maintaining a positive attitude!",
